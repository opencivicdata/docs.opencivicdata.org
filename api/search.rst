Search Endpoints
================

.. warning::
    Parts of Open Civic Data underwent a large refactor as of mid-2014, some information on this
    page may be out of date.   We're working on updating this documentation as soon as possible.

    We'll remove these messages from pages as they're updated and vetted.

General information about search endpoints can be found at :ref:`endpoints` and :ref:`search-response`.

Information on common parameters can be found at :ref:`common-parameters`.

For advanced filtering refer to :ref:`parameters`, for looking up data by non-Open Civic Data IDs look at :ref:`id-operator`.

This page provides specific parameters and notes on which fields are included in the default response for each of the search endpoints.

General Notes
-------------

.. _parameters:

Operators
~~~~~~~~~

All filter parameters are interpreted as direct lookups against the database unless otherwise noted.

Additionally, operators are available.  You can apply an operator by appending ``__op`` to the filter, so ``birth_date`` would become ``birth_date__gt`` if you wanted to use the greater than operator.

Available operators are:

+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Operator | Function                                                                             |
+==========+======================================================================================+
| __gt     | Greater than.                                                                        |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| __gte    | Greater than or equal to.                                                            |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| __lt     | Less than.                                                                           |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| __lte    | Less than or equal to.                                                               |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| __ne     | Not equal to.                                                                        |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| __all    | Content is split by ``,`` - filter ensures all values provided are in the object.    |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| __in     | Content is split by ``,`` - filter includes objects with any of the values provided. |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| __nin    | Content is split by ``,`` - filter excludes objects with any of the values provided. |
+----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. _id-operator:

External IDs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the Open Civic Data ID for an object, it is sometimes necessary to look up an object
by an external ID.  As objects are pulled into the system from other sources
(for example `Open States <http://openstates.org>`) we preserve their old IDs in the ``identifiers``
attribute on the object.  It is possible to query within this object by using ``id__<scheme>=<identifier>``
as a filter on any query.  For example ``/people/id__openstates=AKL000001`` would return the person that
had the Open States ID AKL000001.

(This typically shouldn't be combined with other filters since it should always
only return one item.)


.. _timestamp-parameters:

updated_at & created_at
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These parameters are stored in the system as UTC timestamps, not strings.  The following formats are accepted:

* Y-m-d
* Y-m
* Y
* Y-m-dTH:M
* Y-m-dTH:M:S
* Y-m-dTH:M:S.f
* ``now``        - Special input interpreted as the current time. Useful for asking for events that haven't happened yet.

For details on time formats see `Python strftime() and strptime() behavior <http://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior>`_.
