Overview
========

Definition of the Open Civic Data Jurisdiction type.


Rationale
=========

A Jurisdiction represents a logical unit of governance.

Examples would include: the United States Federal Government, the Government of the District of Columbia,
the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government, or the Wake County Public School System.

The following would not be considered Jurisdictions:

* Bethesda, MD - Bethesda is a `Census Designated Place <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census-designated_place>`_ and as such has no formal government.
* North Carolina's General Assembly - The General Assembly is part of the state government, and would be an ``Organization`` within North Carolina's government.

Additionally, Open Civic Data Jurisdictions should not be confused with the concept of judicial jurisdiction, whichis an altogether different issue that we do not attempt to address.

All entities within the Open Civic Data ecosystem are related (directly or indirectly) to a Jurisdiction, and so, along with Divisions (which Jurisdictions themselves depend upon), Jurisdictions can be viewed as one of the foundational pieces of Open Civic Data.

Implementation
==============

The Jurisdiction type has the following properties:

id
    An ID in the format ``ocd-jurisdiction/country:<country_code>(/<type>:<type_id>)*/<classification>`` (where the first part of the ID is identical to the related ``Division``.)

    The following pattern should be used create a ``jurisdiction_id`` given a ``division_id`` and ``classification``::

        jurisdiction_id = (division_id.replace('ocd-division', 'ocd-jurisdiction') +
                            '/' + classification)

name
    The common name of the Jurisdiction, such as 'Wyoming' or 'Hope County School System'

url
    The primary website of the body represented.

classification
    The type of jurisdiction being defined, current options are:

    * government     - A combined government for a city, county, state, or country where the
                       legislature and executive (and possibly judicial) branches form a cohesive
                       whole that should be considered as one.  (The United States is one such
                       example.)
    * legislature    - A legislature in a region in which there is no unified legislative-executive
                       government.  An example would be a Parliament in
                       `Westminster systems <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_system>`_.
    * executive      - An executive branch in a region in which there is no unified
                       legislative-executive government.  An example would be the cabinet in
                       `Westminster systems <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_system>`_.
    * school_system  - A school system that is independent from a city/county government.
    * park_district  - A park district that is independent from a city/county government.
    * sewerage_district - A sewerage district that is independent from a city/county government.
    * forest_preserve_district - A forest preserve district that is independent from city/county government
    * transity_authority - An independent transit autority

    end_date
        End date of session in YYYY-MM-DD format (may be approximate by leaving off -MM-DD or -DD portion).
