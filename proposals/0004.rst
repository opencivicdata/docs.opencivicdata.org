Overview
========

Definition of Open Civic Data Events.

Definitions
-----------

Event
    Something happening at a given time and location, past, present or future.

Media
    Audio and/or Video recordings.

Agenda
    Points to be discussed at the event, as defined in the Agenda section below.

Rationale
=========

A core part of the democratic process is ensuring that citizens have representation and a say in how the government operates. One important way in which this happens is through hearings and opportunities for public testimony. As such, Open Civic Data Events need to be able to store data such as hearings, and provide structure to represent this aspect of government.

Implementation
==============

Core Fields

classification
    Classification of the event. Current values (which may be expanded) are
    ``committee-meeting`` and ``hearing``.

start_time
    Starting time of the event. This field is serialized as an ISO 8601
    datetime string, normalized to UTC, and must be fully datetime aware.
    ISO 8601 defines times expressed in UTC with a special UTC designator
    ("Z") as the timezone.

timezone
    This must always be set to the timezone in which the event is held. This
    also aids in display, since you may always know what the local time of the
    event is.

    datetime string, normalized to UTC, and must be fully datetime aware.
    ISO 8601 defines times expressed in UTC with a special UTC designator
    ("Z") as the timezone.
