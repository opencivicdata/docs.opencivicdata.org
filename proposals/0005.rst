OCDEP 5: People, Organizations, Posts, and Memberships
======================================================

Overview
========

Adoption of `Popolo <http://popoloproject.com/>`_ types for the Open Civic Data Person, Organization, Post, and Membership types.

Definitions
-----------

Person
    An individual that has served in a political office.

Organization
    A group of people, typically in a legislative or rule-making context.

Post
    A position in an organization that exists independently of the person holding it.

Membership
    A relationship between a Person and an Organization, possibly including a Post.

Rationale
=========

At the core of the Open Civic Data mission is helping people discover who represents them and the structure of their government.  People, Posts, Organizations, and Memberships are the means to describing that structure.

Furthermore, we have adopted (with minor differences) the Popolo schemas for these objects in the aim of being interoperable with a wide range of civic software that is being built, and due to the technical merits and completeness of the specification.


Implementation
==============

To avoid duplicating the entire Popolo specification, this proposal only aims to highlight the differences (omitted or added fields) between Popolo and the Open Civic Data implementation.

Person
------

The basis for the Open Civic Data ``Person`` object is the `Popolo Person <http://popoloproject.com/specs/person.html>`_.

Omitted Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several fields have been omitted:

family_name, given_name, additional_name, honorific_prefix, honorific_suffix, patronymic_name
    Due to the inherent fragile nature of trying to segment names, all name fields other than
    ``name``, ``sort_name``, and ``other_names`` are omitted to avoid implying that they can be
    relied upon.

email
    Considered redundant with using an entry in ``Person.contact_details`` with type ``email``.


Additional Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

extras
    Common to all Open Civic Data types, the value is a key-value store suitable for storing arbitrary information not covered elsewhere.

Organization
------------

The basis for the Open Civic Data ``Organization`` object is the `Popolo Organization <http://popoloproject.com/specs/organization.html>`_.

Omitted Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

area, area_id
    Open Civic Data does not make use of the Popolo ``Area`` type here,
    instead favoring the concept of ``Jurisdiction`` as described in :ref:`OCDEP3`.  (See :ref:`areas`)


Additional Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

chamber
    Used to distinguish between upper and lower legislative organizations (House/Senate for instance).

jurisdiction, jurisdiction_id
    An organization exists as part of a ``Jurisdiction`` as described in :ref:`OCDEP3`.  (See :ref:`areas`)

extras
    Common to all Open Civic Data types, the value is a key-value store suitable for storing arbitrary information not covered elsewhere.

Post
----

The basis for the Open Civic Data ``Post`` object is the `Popolo Post <http://popoloproject.com/specs/post.html>`_.


Omitted Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

other_label
    This field was added to Popolo after our adoption, and we have not yet found a need to add it.


Additional Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

division, division_id
    An post may have an associated ``Division``, which is a synonym of Popolo's ``Area``. (See :ref:`areas`)

    These fields are synonymous with ``area`` and ``area_id``.
    It is strongly suggested that both exist for compatibility reasons.

extras
    Common to all Open Civic Data types, the value is a key-value store suitable for storing arbitrary information not covered elsewhere.


Membership
----------

The basis for the Open Civic Data ``Membership`` object is the `Popolo Membership <http://popoloproject.com/specs/membership.html>`_.


Omitted Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

area, area_id
    Memberships are not used to relate to defined areas/divisions, this must be done through a ``Post``.

member, member_id
    We do not support Organization-Organization memberships, and therefore use the more specific
    ``person`` and ``person_id`` fields

Additional Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

extras
    Common to all Open Civic Data types, the value is a key-value store suitable for storing arbitrary information not covered elsewhere.

.. _areas:


Areas, Divisions, and Jurisdictions
-----------------------------------

Two main differences have emerged between our handling of political areas and that of Popolo:

The first difference is the use of ``Division`` instead of ``Area`` on ``Post``.  ``Division`` in Open Civic Data
predates ``Area``'s inclusion in Popolo, but the two are now essentially synonymous.  For compatibility reasons
Open Civic Data will continue to use the term Division, but for compatibility with other Popolo-based
systems ``area`` and ``area_id`` should be present in any API.

Additionally, Open Civic Data uses the concept of Jurisdictions, which represent entities with authority over a given area.  (For more detail on Jurisdictions see :ref:`OCDEP3`.)

Due to the presence of Jurisdictions, a decision was made to not use ``area & area_id`` on Organizations, instead  ``Organization`` objects are linked instead to a ``Jurisdiction``.  A link to ``Division`` (a synonym for ``Area`` does exist on ``Jurisdiction`` so it is still possible to get the ``Area`` represented by an ``Organization``).
