Overview
========

Definition of Open Civic Data Bill schema.

Rationale
=========

Bills are the primary artifact of legislatures, proposals to modify or create laws.  Open Civic Data
Bills are the representation of this concept, which may sometimes be known by other names such as
Proposal, Resolution, or Measure.

Implementation
==============

id
    A unique ID in the format ``ocd-bill/{uuid}``.

session, session_id
    A reference to a ``legislative_session`` from the relevant ``Jurisdiction`` (see :ref:`OCDEP3` for details)

identifier
    A name for the bill, such as 'HB 1' or '2117'.

title
    The current title of the bill, such as 'The Patient Protectionand Affordable Care Act'.

from_organization, from_organization_id
    **optional**
    The organization that the bill was originally introduced in.  In the US this would be the organization
    representing the House if it were a House bill or resolution, and the Senate if it were a Senate bill.

    This field can be omitted if it is not known or there is not a single chamber of introduction (such as
    a Joint Resolution).

classification
    A list of classifications for this bill, suggested values would be things like 'bill',
    'resolution', 'constitutional amendment', etc.

subject
    **optional**
    A curated list of subject areas that this bill is a part of.

abstracts
    A list of objects representing available abstracts (aka summaries) for the bill, each with the
    following fields:

    abstract
        The text of the abstract.

    note
        **optional**
        A note about the origin of the summary, such as 'minority caucus report'.

other_titles
    A list of objects representing alternate titles for the bill.

    title
        The text of an alternate title that someone might use to refer to the bill,
        an example might be "Obamacare" for the Affordable Care Act.

    note
        **optional**
        A note describing the origin of the title.

other_identifiers
    A list of objects representing alternate identifiers for the bill.

    Also note that this is to refer to bills that have multiple names, such as in Tennessee where
    bills are given a House and Senate number but have shared history.  In states where there
    are two related bills with distinct parallel histories, a second Bill object should be
    created and the ``related_bill`` property (described below) should be used.

    name
        The alternate name (e.g. HB 7)

    note
        **optional**
        A note describing the reason for the alternate name.

    scheme
        **optional**
        If the identifier belongs to a 3rd-party site (such as OpenStates.org assigned bill ids)
        it must provide a scheme, scheme should be omitted if it is an identifier from the
        primary source.

actions
    A list of objects representing individual actions that take place on a bill, comprising the
    legislative history of the proposal in question.  Actions consist of the following properties:

    organization
        The organization that this action took place within.

    description
        Description of the action.

    date
        The date the action occurred in YYYY-MM-DD format. (can be partial by omitting -MM-DD or
        -DD component).

    classification
        A list of classifications for this actions, suggested values would be things like
        'passage', 'introduction', etc.

    related_entities
        A list of all related entities (such as legislators mentioned by name in the action).
        Each entity has the following fields:

        name
            The upstream-given name of this related entity.

        entity_type
            'organization' or 'person' - the type of entity that is related

        organization, organization_id
            If the ``entity_type`` is 'organization' and the entity is resolved, will be the
            organization that is related.

        person, person_id
            If the ``entity_type`` is 'person' and the entity is resolved, will be the
            person that is related.

    sponsorships
        A list of all sponsoring people and organizations.

        primary
            A boolean that is true if the sponsor can be considered 'primary.'  The exact meaning
            of this is jurisdiction-dependent.

            **Note:** this can often be derived from classification, but can often be highly
            jurisdiction dependent (among US states for example the terms author, sponsor,
            cosponsor, and coauthor can mean quite different things).  Because of this, and the
            frequent need to indicate which author(s) should be displayed in a short list of
            sponsors when the full list might be half of the legislature or more, we've chosen
            to include this field.

        classification
            The classification of the sponsor, such as 'cosponsor' or 'author'.

        name
            The upstream-given name of this sponsor.

        entity_type
            'organization' or 'person' - the type of the sponsor.

        organization, organization_id
            If the ``entity_type`` is 'organization' and the entity is resolved, will be the
            sponsoring organization.

        person, person_id
            If the ``entity_type`` is 'person' and the entity is resolved, will be the
            sponsoring individual.
