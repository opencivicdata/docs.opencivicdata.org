OCDEP: Campaign Finance Filings
====================

:Created: 
:Author: Abraham Epton

Overview
========

Definition of the ``Filing`` type and associated other types to model campaign
finance filings with a regulator.

Definitions
-----------

Campaign Finance regulator
    Any government agency (Regulator) in charge of gathering information and
    enforcing transparency laws against political committees (Committees).

Filing
    Any single document filed with a Regulator.

Jurisdiction
    The region covered by an Office, or for which an Election is being held.

Agent
    A person or organization.

Section
    A container for a unit of meaning inside a Filing, that isn't inherent to
    the basic process of filing a document with an agency.

Rationale
=========

Political committees file statements with their regulators in order to disclose
funders, expenditures, organizational ties and other financial details.
Filings encapsulate some number of possible specific disclosures, and some
filings can contain more than one type of disclosure, so this proposed option is
to consider each actual filing as an object and then each specific disclosed
piece of information as associated with that object. So a CommitteeNameChange
would be associated with a Filing, along with a CommitteeAddressChange and a
CommitteeOfficerAddition. A series of CommitteeContributions and
CommitteeExpenses would be attached to one Filing. This way we don't need to
model the specific disclosure forms in each state, and just directly extract
the most meaningful parts of the filing.

We want to make it easy for people to do manipulations on top of this data,
while ensuring that this system itself does as little manipulation as possible
to the underlying data from reports filed. For instance, many records include
Agent entities - these are deterministically extracted from just the available
filing data, e.g. an address, employer, occupation and name are all extracted
for each contribution. Deduplication can then happen with each of these
entities, but they are themselves totally reproducible from just the filing
information.

This model entails that Filings have Sections - a Filing can, and often will,
have multiple Sections. As much of the specific logic as possible should be
pushed down into Sections, which offer flexibility by allowing us to compose
them together to reproduce the data from state-specific reports. We can model
a particular state filing form as a Filing with a specific set of expected
Sections to be present. Some attributes that might make sense as properties of a
Filing, such as Amendments, are here presented as Sections; the line between the
two is muddy, but this proposal tries to keep Filings as minimal as possible.

Finally, the different entity types presented here present either current or
likely future conflicts with other entities in the Open Civic Data namespace, so
this proposal doesn't make any attempt to resolve those conflicts since they
seem ancillary for now.

TODO
----
* Make filing activity actions use same pattern as OCD bill actions (@aepton)

Questions to answer
-------------------
* How to model Committee Status and Committee Purpose inside of OCD Organization
  models?
* How to reconcile multiple reports that describe the same contribution,
  expenditure or other event?
* How to handle different types of Committees beyond just imputing their types
  based on (say) whether they are oriented toward more than one Candidate?
* How should amendments work? Should there be some notion of versions of
  filings? Should all data from a given filing, even if 99% is redundant with a
  prior version of same filing, be stored, or should we store a diff?
* Should we make/preserve the distinction FEC makes between contributions and
  receipts (every contribution is a receipt; not every receipt is a
  contribution)? How do we handle presumably-unique transaction IDs that
  nevertheless have to get versioned somehow?

Implementation
==============

Filing
------

id
    Open Civic Data-style id in the format ``ocd-campaignfinance-filing/{{uuid}}``

identifiers
    **optional**
    Upstream ids of the disclosure if any exist, such as the filing ID assigned by the Senate Office of Public Record

classification
    **optional**
    Filing Type (jurisdiction-specific)

agent
    Committee making the Filing.

coverage_start_date
    **optional**
    Date (and possibly time) when filing period of coverage begins.

coverage_end_date
    **optional**
    Date (and possibly time) when filing period of coverage ends.

recipient
    Regulator to which the Filing was submitted.

sources
    **optional**
    **repeated**
    List of sources used in assembling this object. Has the following
    properties:

    url
        URL of the resource.
    note
        **optional**
        Description of what this source was used for.

actions
    A list of objects representing individual actions that take place on a
    filing, such as initial filing, amendments, withdrawals, etc. Actions
    consist of the following properties:

    id
        Open Civic Data-style id in the format ``ocd-campaignfinance-filingaction/{{uuid}}``

    description
        Description of the action.

    date
        The date the action occurred.

    classification
        **repeated**
        A list of classifications for this action, such as "amendment" or
        "revocation" - allows for consolidating different jurisdictional
        amendment schemes into standard types.

    agent
        **optional**
        **repeated**
        Agent responsible for the action, usually the filer of the amendment or
        withdrawal. Theoretically this could be an Organization of some kind as
        well.

    supersedes_prior_versions
        Boolean indicating whether this action renders everything contained
        in previous versions of this Filing invalid.

    transactions
        List of the Transactions attached to this version of the Filing.

    is_current
        Boolean indicating whether data from this action (primarily the
        transaction list) should be considered current or not.

election
    **repeated**
    **optional**
    Election(s) relevant to this filing. This is the upcoming Election for which
    a donation is being disclosed, say, or a recently-passed Election for which
    a Committee is announcing the closing of its books.
    
created_at
    Time that this object was created at in the system, not to be confused with the date of introduction.
updated_at
    Time that this object was last updated in the system, not to be confused with the last action.
extras
    Common to all Open Civic Data types, the value is a key-value store suitable for storing arbitrary information not covered elsewhere.    
    

Committee
---------

Subclass of Popolo Organization.

id
    Open Civic Data-style id in the format ``ocd-campaignfinance-committee/{{uuid}}``

identifier
    **optional**
    In some jurisdictions, the original jurisdictionally-assigned ID of a
    Committee may be meaningful, so preserve it here.

name
    Name of the Committee

committee_type
    Committee Type

statuses
    Current status of the Committee. List of date ranges and status types
    (active, inactive, contesting election, not contesting election, etc)
    describing the time period at which a given status applied to the Committee.

    start_date
        First date at which the status applied (inclusive).

    end_date
        **optional**
        Last date at which the status applied (inclusive). In many cases, the
        current status won't have a known end_date associated with it, so this
        is optional to reflect that.

    note
        Description of the status.

    classification
        **repeated**
        A list of classifications for this status, such as "active" or
        "contesting election" - allows for consolidating different
        jurisdictional status schemes into standard types.    

description
    **optional**
    Purpose of the Committee if any is given.

designations
    **optional**
    **repeated**
    The Candidate Designations that apply to this Committee - i.e., is it supporting or
    opposing certain candidates?

Committee Type
--------------

id
    Open Civic Data-style id in the format ``ocd-campaignfinance-committeetype/{{uuid}}``

name
    Name of the Committee Type

jurisdiction
    Presumably a state, but: whatever jurisdiction the Committe Type is
    meaningful within. This allows us to have "Candidate Committee"s in 2
    different states that adhere to whatever different rules apply in those
    places.

Candidate Designation
---------------------

A Committee may have no relation to any specific Candidate, but if they do have
such a relationship, the options are complex. Hence this type.

id
    Open Civic Data-style id in the format ``ocd-campaignfinance-candidateorientation/{{uuid}}``

candidate
    Candidate

designation
    Enumerated among "supports", "opposes", "primary vehicle for", "surplus
    account for", "independent expenditure" and other relationship types.

Agent
-----

This system assumes that each Agent will be generated from a specific line item
in a Filing. As such, we may know nothing about the Agent but their name. Also,
sometimes and as far as I can see inevitably, some Agents (many in fact) will
be corporations or other distinctly non-human entities, Supremes Court
notwithstanding.

This type is a proposed OCD Popolo Agent.

Regulator
---------

OCD Organization model.


Filing Type
----------------

id
    Open Civic Data-style id in the format ``ocd-campaignfinance-filingtype/{{uuid}}``

name
    Name of filing type - "Last Minute Contributions", etc.

code
    Probably-more-cryptic code for the form associated with the Filing - "A1",
    etc.

jurisdiction
    Jurisdiction for which the Filing Type is relevant.

Transaction (Section)
---------------------

id
    Open Civic Data-style id in the format ``ocd-campaignfinance-transaction/{{uuid}}``
    
filing_action
    Reference to the ``Filing.action.id`` that a transaction is reported in.

identifier
    **optional**
    In some jurisdictions, the original jurisdictionally-assigned ID of a
    Transaction may be meaningful, so preserve it here.

classification
    Type of transaction - contribution, expenditure, loan, transfer, other
    receipt, etc. Enumerated field based on the jurisdiction of the Committee
    filing the Transaction.

amount
    Amount of transaction.

    value
        Actual decimal amount of transaction.

    currency
        Currency denomination of transaction.

    is_inkind
        Boolean indicating whether transaction is in-kind or not (in which case,
        it's probably cash.)

    Agent making contribution, or paying for expenditure, etc.

recipient
    Agent receiving contribution, or being paid for an expenditure, etc.

date
    Date reported for transaction.
