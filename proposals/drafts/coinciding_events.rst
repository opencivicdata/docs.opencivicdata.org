Overview
========

Some events occur are scheduled at the same time and place as other events. For example, there may be a hearing
scheduled during a regular committee meeting. 

Proposal
========

Allow multiple events to be scheduled for the same time and place, *if* the participants are the same.

Alternatives
============

Let events have a parent event. 
    The hearing may seem to be a subevent of the committee meeting. However, a hearing need not only happen 
    during a committee meeting.
Put hearings on a parent event's agenda
     This hearing does seem to be part of the business of this meeting. However, the hearing is not on the 
     official agenda and we should not editorialize.
