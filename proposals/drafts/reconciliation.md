## Notes

- match endpoint
- add endpoint
- bulk add endpoint
- bulk access to data
- copyright assignment to whom (shouldn't be datamade)


## Key questions:
1. What's the governance for accepting new entities
2. What's the governance for merging and splitting existing entities
3. If there is a merge or split how will changed entity ids propogate
4. While DataMade can commit to supporting the service we are not going to make our full stack of dedupe.io open source
is this a problem
5. What type of entities are in scope--probably start with people.
