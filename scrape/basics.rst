Getting Started Writing Scrapers
================================

While we strive to make writing scrapers as simple as possible, there are a few prerequisites:

* `Python`_ (or Ruby using `pupa-ruby <https://github.com/opennorth/pupa-ruby>`_)
* `Understanding GitHub`_
* `Scraping Basics`_

If you're already well-versed in Python, GitHub, and basics of web scraping you can skip to `Getting Started`_.

.. note::

    These instructions are intended for Linux or OS X.  If you're using Windows you'll probably benefit from using something like `MinGW <http://www.mingw.org/>`_ or a VM running Linux.  If you're using OS X you may also find the excellent `OS X-specific docs <https://github.com/opennorth/opennorth.ca/wiki/Python-Quick-Start%3A-OS-X>`_ published by `Open North <https://github.com/opennorth/>`_  useful.


Python
-----
 
If you aren't already familiar with Python you might want to start with `Python on Codecademy <http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python>`_.

.. note::

    Make sure you are using Python 3.3 or newer.

Having a reasonable local development environment is recommended, `virtualenv <httpe://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ & `virtualenvwrapper <http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ are optional tools that will help you keep your Python environment clean if you work on multiple projects.


Understanding GitHub
--------------------

Contributing code requires a free `GitHub <http://github.com>`_ account, if you haven't use Git before there's a `Git tutorial <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-all>`_ to get you started.


Scraping Basics
---------------

It is probably useful to understand the basic concept of web scraping before beginning, which is somewhat beyond the scope of this documentation.

We recommend the `lxml.html <http://lxml.de/lxmlhtml.html>`_ library. If you work with jQuery but haven't used XPath you may also find `lxml.cssselect <http://lxml.de/cssselect.html>`_ useful, though it is a bit more limited.

In our experience spending a few minutes brushing up on the basics of `XPath <http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/xpath_syntax.asp>`_ is well worth it as it makes scrapers easier to write and more maintainable in the long run.


Getting Started
---------------

The first thing to do is to choose a repository to work with, or create a new one.

Most likely you'll be creating a fork of one of the existing scraper repositories:

* `scrapers-us-municipal <https://github.com/opencivicdata/scrapers-us-municipal>`_ - US municipal governments
* `scrapers-ca <https://github.com/opencivicdata/scrapers-ca>`_ - Canadian legislative
* `scrapers-us-municipal <https://github.com/influence-usa/scrapers-us-state>`_ - US state influence data

If your scraper falls into one of those categories you should fork it and create a new directory within that repository.  We'd also suggest you work on a branch to make merging changes as easy as possible.

If you're hoping to create a scraper for something not yet covered please email the `Open Civic Data list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-civic-data>`_ and we can work with you to decide the best way to proceed.

Once you've chosen a repository you'll need to install the `pupa` library, as well as any other dependencies (like `lxml`) that you'll be using to do your scraping.

An example of how you might configure your setup:

.. code-block:: bash

    # using a virtualenv highly recommended
    $ mkvirtualenv -p `which python3` opencivicdata
    # Install pupa
    $ pip install -U pupa
    # Clone the repo that you forked on GitHub
    $ git clone git@github.com:<yourusername>/scrapers-us-state.git
    # Switch to a branch to make pulling your work later as easy as possible
    $ cd scrapers-us-state
    $ git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
    # ...do work...
    $ git push -u origin <new-branch-name>

If you're all set up, you can move on to :doc:`new`.
