Submitting a Pull Request
=====================================

The municipal scraping effort we're working on is extremely friendly to contributors of all backgrounds, and we accept code contributions via GitHub Pull Requests.

Before you begin, you should create a GitHub account if you don't already have one, and learn the basics of using Git (slightly out of scope for this document). This guide assumes basic proficiency with Git.

Please test your scraper locally, but if you have questions we're all quite happy to go back and forth in the github comments to work on changes, if they're needed.

In general, if you just keep the Pull Request short and self-contained. If you'll be modifying multiple jurisdictions, please submit separate pull requests. It will make life much easier for the reviewers!


Fork the repo you want to contribute to
---------------------------------------------

First navigate to the repo you want to contribute to and create a fork. If you're contributing a municipal scraper within the United States, for example, view `that repo's page on Github <https://github.com/opencivicdata/scrapers-us-municipal>`_ and click the ``fork`` button.

This creates a repo (called ``scrapers-us-municipal``, if you've followed the link just up above) on your personal account that you can commit to.

You can ``clone`` this repo down to your local machine by using `git clone` (do read up on the `GitHub guide <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo#step-2-clone-your-fork>`_ if you're having trouble with this step - or git!)

After pulling the repo down, we'll set a new remote called ``upstream`` to help interact with the ``opencivicdata`` repo later on.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:opencivicdata/municipal-scrapers-us.git

If you cloned the ``opencivicdata`` repo before you forked the repo on GitHub, don't worry - you can adjust this fairly quickly!

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git remote rm origin
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:yourbadself/municipal-scrapers-us.git
    $ git fetch origin

Submit a pull request
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you submit your Pull Request, it's quite handy to run through a quick checklist of common (and easy to catch) gotchas:

  * Have you added yourself to the ``AUTHORS`` file? If not, please do.
  * Is your Pull Request up-to-date with the ``opencivicdata`` repo? If it's not, it might be helpful to jump down to the
    ``Keeping your branch up to date`` section below.

Finally, navigate to the commit you made to your forked repo, and click the button to submit a pull request.

Best Practice
-------------

.. note::
    This guide won't get into a generic ``git`` tutorial, and assumes basic proficiency with ``git`` and some knowledge of GitHub.

It's good practice to use a branch when working on the scrapers, this helps continue to integrate changes into your branch, and helps you compare changes without much effort. With many people working on the codebase at the same time,
it's likely we'll end up with changes that impact others sometimes. By using a branch, it's much easier to fix these conflicts.

.. warning::
    Please do make sure you always create a branch off the *master* branch, unless you've got lots of git experience and are doing this for a very specific reason.

To create a branch, you can checkout a new branch (this operation creates the branch, so don't worry about using ``git branch`` just yet.)

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout -b bugfix/fix-this-broken-jurisdiction

It's common to prefix a branch with one of ``bugfix``, or ``feature`` (or anything else that's short and desriptive). After the prefix, you should add a descriptive slug related to the change, so that it's easy to remember which branch is which. These are sometimes called "Topic branches".

After this, you can check which branch you're working on by running ``git branch``, and looking for the marked branch.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git branch
    * bugfix/fix-this-broken-jurisdiction
      master

To switch back to the master branch (for any reason), you can ``checkout`` the branch again.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout master
    $ git branch
      bugfix/fix-this-broken-jurisdiction
    * master

Keeping your branch up to date
------------------------------

It saves quite a bit of time if you can ensure that all changes have been incorporated in your branch when sending in a Pull Request. Often times this is not an issue for short-lived branches, however, sometimes people have changed code in the ``opencivicdata`` repo, and you need to merge code from "``upstream``" into your working branch.

Let's go over how to do this.

.. warning::
    The following assumes you have a setup similar to above. Make sure that you have the `upstream` remote set up, and are working on a topic branch.

Firstly, be sure that you've commited all your code, and you're up to date.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git branch
    * bugfix/fix-this-broken-jurisdiction
      master
    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull upstream master
    $ git checkout bugfix/fix-this-broken-jurisdiction
    $ git merge master

Please do remember to change ``bugfix/fix-this-broken-jurisdiction`` with the name of your topic branch that you're working on (as seen in the output of the first command run).

Checking what you've changed
----------------------------

You can check how much has changed at any point very simply, by using
``git diff``. Something like::

    $ git diff master --color

Can come in quite handy when reviewing changes before sending in a Pull Request.
